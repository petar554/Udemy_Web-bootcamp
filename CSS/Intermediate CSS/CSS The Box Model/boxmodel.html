    <!-- -CSS BOX MODEL
    -Imagine that we have some box for example, and inside the box some content (paragraph)
    -So there are four properties or four different parts of every box
    -So we have some text, and around the text border with yellow or orange color, and this is what users sees, but
    behind the scenes there is actually some other things happening.
    -Between the border and text exist something called padding.
    -And also margin which is on the order side, it's between border on outside and something else. -->
